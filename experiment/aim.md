### Aim

The aim of this experiment is to understand and apply numerical differentiation techniques using a simulation tool by performing the following steps:

1. To input a mathematical function and define a range with evenly spaced data points.
2. To apply different numerical differentiation methods including:
   - Forward Difference Method
   - Backward Difference Method
   - Central Difference Method
3. To generate and observe numerical derivative values through tabular output.
4. To analyze and compare the original function with its numerical derivative using graphical visualization.
5. To study the effect of step size and method selection on the accuracy of derivative estimation.
6. To develop practical insight into how numerical differentiation supports engineering and scientific computations when analytical derivatives are not available.
