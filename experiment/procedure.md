### Procedure

1. Open the simulation interface for the numerical differentiation experiment.

2. Enter the mathematical function to be differentiated and specify the range of the independent variable with evenly spaced data points.

3. Define the step size or ensure that the spacing between successive data points is uniform.

4. Select the numerical differentiation method from the available options:

- Forward Difference Method

- Backward Difference Method

- Central Difference Method

5. Click the Submit button to execute the selected numerical differentiation method.

6. Observe the numerical values of the derivative displayed in tabular form.

7. Compare the numerical derivative values obtained using different differentiation methods.

8. Analyze the graphical representation to compare the original function with its numerically approximated derivative.

9. Repeat the experiment by varying the step size and differentiation method to study their effect on the accuracy of the derivative approximation.

10. Record the observations and draw conclusions regarding the performance and accuracy of the numerical differentiation methods.
