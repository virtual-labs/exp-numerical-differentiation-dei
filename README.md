### About the Experiment  

This experiment focuses on the numerical techniques used to approximate derivatives of functions when only discrete data points are available. It involves methods such as Forward Difference, Backward Difference, and Central Difference formulas, specifically applied to evenly spaced points. The experiment helps students understand how differentiation can be approximated numerically when analytical methods are difficult or impossible to apply. It also provides insights into error estimation, accuracy of different formulas, and the practical importance of numerical differentiation in solving real-world scientific and engineering problems.
